	<h1>general</h1>
	<p>
		Having a technical background I strongly believe that people should share their knowledge and skills.
		For that reason I have made the entire source code of this website entirely available on GitHib. Feel free to steal anything on this website,
		I myself have also used materials of other developers/engineers for technical purpose and for inspiration. I try to credit authors in the comments.
		Note that I do not consider this site as being very unique or impressive, but I did put a lot of effort into it and have pride in the work I do.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is also an another (hidden?) reason for this, with the source easily accessible, potential clients or employers can always assess my level of skill
		in Front End Development and the related tools. Making the code available in a git repository is always more convenient for any recruiter.

	<h1>Credits</h1>
	<p>If you are reading through the code, I did try to credit significant implementations to the original authors and/or tutorials.</p>
	<p>Special shout to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LucBos">Luc Bos</a> for helping me host this site.</p>

	<h1>Code</h1>
	<p>You can just clone or download the code straight from GitHub.</p>
