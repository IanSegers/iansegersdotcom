	<h1>who</h1>
	<p>
		Hi there, my name is Ian. I am a versatile software engineer with a keen interest for business and entrepreneurship.
		To show you how I might be able to assist you, I'll quickly recap my career, bear with me ;)
	</p>

	<h2>the past</h2>

	<p>
		After leaving Belgium for my erasmus studies in Finland and my internship in India, I realized how small the world is. So I chose to seek my next challenge abroad.
		I started my career back in 2012 as one of the first full-time employees at a really cool Norwegian startup in Oslo, named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialcee.com">SocialCee</a>.
		As the SocialCee team grew in the following 4 years, I grew along with the company from being a developer, to a team lead and ended up as Head of Development.
		Halfway through my time with the company, I relocated to Gdansk, Poland to assist in bootstrapping the near-shore office.
	</p>

	<p>
		Throughout this journey I was lucky to be working with some very inspiring people which allowed me to be involved with many aspects of the building and growing of a company. Ranging from the development, devops, product management,
		vision, partner communication to our business model. The SocialCee-service provides online marketing with a speciality in Social Media.
	</p>

	<p>
		Along this Journey I caught the entrepreneurial virus. In the spring of 2016 I decided to leave my job at SocialCee to take a leap of faith with a few friends and launch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nexpat.net/">Nexpat</a>.
		After a few months of preparation followed by a few months of full time hard work, meetings, coding, research, relocation to Berlin, frustration and joy, me and my co-founders were sad to have to end the project.
		Why, would you ask? Well, for every successful start-up story there are 10 failures. I soon hope to be able to publish a few blog posts about my Nexpat start-up journey; the lessons I learned and the reasons why ended sooner than expected.
		Follow me online and you will find out more about it ;)
	</p>

	<h2>the present</h2>
	<p>
		Currently I am unemployed and living in Berlin. I took the oppertunity to have a small break and chat with friends and former co-workers about some interesting projects, products and ideas.
	</p>

	<h2>the future</h2>
	<p>
		So what now? I am searching for a cool new opportunity, a project or a start up. I am very open to any type of ideas. I prefer an exciting challenge which involves building a team, vision, product or even a company.
		I have a strong background in software engineering and experience with starting and a business. Are you seeking a new team member or co-worker to help you out with your project?
		Get in touch with me! I am a socialable and open person, I am eager to work on any cool and fresh ideas. If you would be interested in working with me,
		I would recommend you have a look at my resume <span ng-click="goToRoute('/resume')" class="clickable" style="text-decoration: underline">here</span>.
	</p>

	<h1>interests</h1>
	<p>
		Yawwwn... Still here? You're doing well! Well I can also tell you about my other interests. They might have an impact on the sexyness of a project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Music : I love music! I have been spinning them old school vinyls since I was 14. Still love doing it. I still own a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/user/PunkDudez/collection">fair collection of vinyls</a>.
		In the past I have been dragging my Serato and Traktor all across the world. In general I listen a lot of electronic music but I am also a fierce lover of any latin music (oh yeah, I love dancing that Salsa).
	</p>

	<p>
		Visual and performing art : Unfortunately this is a hobby which I have not had a lot of time to get into. I am crazy about editing and composing videos and short movies. I used to make many "after" movies for my friends, nothing too serious or professional but feel
		free to check out my "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8_mn8FSG1E">new year after party movie</a>" or my "<a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/76045571">Kazantip</a>" edit.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fashion : Never been an expert in this, but I admire and respect people who understand and apply fashion. I like visual beauty and fashion is the visual art of being able to dress and express.
	</p>
