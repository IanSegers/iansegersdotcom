	<h1>who</h1>
	<p>
		Hi there, I am Ian. I am a versatile software engineer with a keen interest for business and entrepreneurship.
		To understand how I might be able to assist you, I'll recap quickly my career, bear with me ;)
	</p>

	<h2>the past</h2>

	<p>
		After my erasmus studies in Finland and my internship in India, I realized how small the world is. So I chose to seek my next challenge abroad.
		I started my career back in 2012 as one of the first full time employees at a really cool Norwegian startup in Oslo, named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialcee.com">SocialCee</a>.
		As the SocialCee team grew the following 4 years, I grew along with the company from being a developer, to a team lead and in the end to the Head of Development.
		Halfway my career I relocated to Poland, Gdansk to assist in bootstrapping the near-shore office.
	</p>

	<p>
		During this journey I was lucky to be working with some very inspiring people that allowed me to be involved with many aspects of the building and growing of a company. Ranging from the development, devops, product management,
		vision, partner communication to our business model. The service of SocialCee is targets at online marketing with a speciality in Social Media.
	</p>

	<p>
		Along this Journey I got infected with the entrepreneur virus. In the spring of 2016 I decided leave my job at SocialCee and take the leap of faith with a few friends to launch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nexpat.net/">Nexpat</a>.
		After a few months of preparation followed by a few months of full time hard work, meetings, coding, research, relocation to Berlin, frustration and joy me and my co founders were sad to have to stop the project.
		Why you would ask? Well, for every success start-up story there are 10 more failures. I hope to be able to publish soon a few blog posts about my Nexpat start-up journey, the lessons I learned and the reasons why it came to a quick end.
		Follow me and you will found it out more about it ;)
	</p>

	<h2>the presence</h2>
	<p>
		Currently I am unemployed living in Berlin. I took the liberty to have a small hiatus and chat with friends and former co-workers about some interesting projects, products and ideas.
	</p>

	<h2>the future</h2>
	<p>
		So what now? I am in search for a cool new opportunity, a project or a start up. I am very open to any type of ideas. I prefer an exciting challenge that involves aspects like, building a team, vision, product or even a company.
		I have strong experience in software engineering and experience with growing and starting a business. Are you seeking a new team member or co-worker to help you out with your project?
		Get in touch with me! I am a social and open person, I am eager to work on any cool and fresh ideas. If you would be interested to work with me,
		I would advice you to check out my resume <span ng-click="goToRoute('/resume')" class="clickable" style="text-decoration: underline">here</span>.

	<h1>interests</h1>
	<p>
		Yawwwn... Still here? You're doing well on keeping your attention. Well I can tell you also what else interests me. So they might have an impact on the sexyness of a project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Music : I love music! I have been spinning them old school vinyls since I was 14. Still love doing it. I still own a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/user/PunkDudez/collection">fair collection of vinyls</a>.
		In the past I have been dragging my Serato and Traktor all across the world. In general I listen a lot of electronic music but I am also a fierce lover of any latin music (oh yeah, I love dancing that Salsa).
	</p>

	<p>
		Visual and performing art : Unfortunately this is a hobby which I had not much time to get into. I am crazy about editing and composing videos and short movies. I used to make many after movies for my friends, nothing too serious or professional but feel
		free to check out my some simple <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8_mn8FSG1E">new year after party movie</a> I did or my <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/76045571">Kazantip</a> edit.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fashion : Never been an expert in this, but I admire and respect people who understand and apply fashion. I like visual beauty, fashion is a visual art of being able to dress and express.
